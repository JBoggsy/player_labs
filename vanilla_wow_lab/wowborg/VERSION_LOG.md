# wowborg version log

## v51 - held-out course with current-socket refresh (2026-07-30)

- Version UUID: `221a8b82-09f7-4424-9316-caeb20282cbd`
  (`wowborg:v51`, uploaded inert; not submitted to a league).
- Built `linux/amd64` from source commit `15e6a13` with the same untouched
  Durotar course prepared in v49 and v50's current-socket frame recovery.
- Local image manifest:
  `sha256:f3f1bc089da5d0175c67ce26ccf18ad0413aef7356a8a97e2a10648016587256`.
- Purpose: hosted held-out navigation evaluation after v50 clears the recovery
  mechanism gate.

## v50 - current-socket AgentFrame recovery (2026-07-30)

- Version UUID: `04a59594-63fa-477e-86d2-e897917e07ef`
  (`wowborg:v50`, uploaded inert; not submitted to a league).
- Built `linux/amd64` from source commit `15e6a13`; after a stale/deadline
  rejection, the hosted runtime consumes the next pushed frame on the existing
  `/env` connection instead of resetting the Gym lifecycle.
- Local image manifest:
  `sha256:6060e515d0354b9621d24ad7cddadae9d9af6067a710fb31bb4d7ffa4c00ad73`.
- Hosted experiment:
  `xreq_92f74d1c-5a12-49a9-8579-36d435e3d6c2` on certified accelerated-wow
  0.1.124 / `custom-fresh-start-10x`.
- Verdict: frame recovery confirmed, station completion not yet confirmed. Both
  episodes completed with score 1.0 and replay; every refresh advanced, stale
  runs capped at one, and positions changed 264/337 times. Both first reachable
  stations exhausted their no-progress replans during the startup movement stall.

## v49 - held-out Durotar navigation course (2026-07-30)

- Version UUID: `821fe38c-ac0c-4852-ad77-493797f6ad40`
  (`wowborg:v49`, uploaded inert; not submitted to a league).
- Built `linux/amd64` from source commit `34ba007` with a data-only course that
  had never appeared in wowborg code or documentation: east rise, north basin,
  canyon approach, and an intentionally unreachable high-air target.
- Local image manifest:
  `sha256:34288844bb4b36403e51e51d2ab9936c538781d18a67b6468e273127827fdecb`.
- Purpose: held-out hosted evaluation after frame-refresh is established
  independently. This build retains v48's unsuccessful reset-based recovery and
  is superseded before evaluation.

## v48 - stale AgentFrame recovery (2026-07-30)

- Version UUID: `5ef2cfc8-054f-4721-9cdd-503a16d78922`
  (`wowborg:v48`, uploaded inert; not submitted to a league).
- Built `linux/amd64` from source commit `34ba007`; this candidate attempted to
  refresh a stale `AgentFrame` with `VanillaWowEnv.reset()`.
- Local image manifest:
  `sha256:4ddb52f05715c6da3d6268caffaef14f7c3c3c6aa25b85af919704fec645f3c7`.
- Hosted experiment:
  `xreq_2b5eabc9-9a92-4c0a-8055-63f1b77b4796` on certified accelerated-wow
  0.1.124 / `custom-fresh-start-10x`.
- Verdict: rejected. Both episodes ended as `player_error`; reset opened a new
  Gym lifecycle instead of reattaching to the retained session.

## v47 - accelerated-wow 0.1.124 compatibility baseline (2026-07-30)

- Version UUID: `57583ca8-476e-430a-ad3b-bc7c33ce40d0`
  (`wowborg:v47`, uploaded inert; not submitted to a league).
- Built `linux/amd64` from source commit `0a4bc2c` against the certified
  accelerated-wow 0.1.124 contract and deployed game image
  `sha256:ed11e79d...d173a`.
- Adopted the upstream `environment.runtime.episode` module and the consolidated
  `NavmeshRoute` shape. The route lab uses the same compatibility interpretation.
- Local image manifest:
  `sha256:fe23e6c526b05ea88ecae024622322f26bae7442281fdc0ffa54555e011af729`.
- Purpose: establish the first hosted `/env` navigation baseline after the
  game-side session startup fix; no navigation behavior change from v46.

## v46 - canonical `/env` migration (2026-07-29)

- Version UUID: `13b4b697-54d0-4cfe-941a-ed6a3e913211`
  (`wowborg:v46`, uploaded inert; not submitted to a league).
- Replaced every wowborg-owned client path and adapter with the owner-provided
  synchronous Gymnasium contract: `AgentFrame` observations and `AgentAction`
  submissions over hosted `WS /env`.
- Policy image: `linux/amd64`, local manifest
  `sha256:8c3ef0560ba95e024580b0cfe6b42696d006e5f053166d2f8b24f3edbe4cb406`;
  copies only `environment/` and `player/sdk/` from accelerated-wow 0.1.122
  (`sha256:608ac6685...e5e4`). The build rejects historical client binaries.
- Validation before upload: 62/62 wowborg tests; 13/13 declared real-navmesh
  stations; two untouched data-only sequential held-out courses passed 3/3 each:
  scorpid basin → Razor Hill vendor → Razor north field, and south-road west →
  lower canyon west → Barrens gate.
- Hosted runtime request:
  `xreq_52b27d01-17e1-4f5b-860f-cbd096e606bc`, canonical accelerated-wow
  0.1.122 / `custom-fresh-start-10x`.

## v5-v20 - waypoint races: iteration to consistency (2026-07-21/22)

- v3 (`b10f3bb0`): first 0.1.31 contract probe — seam works, no world data (all moves
  failed). v4 (`6242a51a`): VANILLA_WOW_ASSET_SERVICE_URL→--assets fix; random_walk
  102/135 legs, 1,510 yd (replay-confirmed).
- v5 (`purpose=v5-waypoint-race`) → v20 (`purpose=v20-south-rim`): the waypoint_race
  ladder. Key versions: v6 progress-based legs; v8 authored staging chains; v10
  socket-timeout resilience (reconnect + resumable loop); v13 staging hysteresis;
  v16 moving-legs-never-budget-out (zero false DNFs since); v17 course sizing
  (2 near+1 mid+1 far); v19 far-legs-DIRECT (staging retired for long hauls);
  v20 south-rim mid target.
- Endpoint (v19+v20, 8 episodes): 6/8 fully clean, ~1.9 yd/s overall, 740-yd far legs
  in 356-391 s, laps completing. Residual: rare coastal-rock wedge (~1/8); hard tier
  (east field / mesa / NW ridge) quarantined as the future-nav benchmark.


## v3 - nim_control migration (built + fake-server smoked, not yet uploaded)

- Migrated to the game's 0.1.31 policy seam: `action.json` no longer exists upstream;
  the bridge now drives `vanilla_wow.nim_control.v1` (binary-framed local TCP,
  port 41114+slot) — arm external selection via GoalRequest, read EnvironmentFrames
  (observation + dense bindings + factorized action masks), submit one mask-admitted
  FactorizedAction per offered frame, settle via typed ActionSettled. Recon:
  `docs/recon/player-contract-0131-2026-07-21.md`.
- Base image bumped to vanilla_wow 0.1.31 (digest in `tools/versions.env`); player
  images no longer bundle world data — the shim forwards the wrapper's `--assets=<url>`
  to king_richard; session budget derives from KING_NIMROD_SESSION_DEADLINE_SECONDS.
- random_walk is frame-driven now; mask-refused moves fall back to the frame's
  recommended action; death defers to recommended recovery instead of stopping.
- Evidence unchanged (trace/artifact/breadcrumbs); artifact bundle now also carries
  environment-frame.json + decision-audit/leveling-performance/decision-loop-profile
  when present. 0.1.31 caveat: /say text must be in the frame's admitted vocabulary.
- Validated: 57 unit tests (bridge tests run the real wow_sdk client from the pinned
  image's SDK snapshot against a scripted control server); image builds amd64;
  end-to-end container smoke (fake king_richard serving the control socket): goal
  armed, 5+ legs selected/settled, positions tracked, clean teardown.

## v2 - shim adoption: random-point navigator

- Version UUID: `eb6aa13e-4fcd-4037-a443-42fc7ae676d0` (uploaded 2026-07-15,
  `players-wowborg:dev` linux/amd64, tag `purpose=v2-shim-random-walk`).

- Architecture change: our policy now drives the game's bundled Nim client
  (`king_richard --scenario=nim-control`, autonomous planner off) through its file
  bridge, layered on the DEPLOYED reference player image (vanilla_wow 0.1.19 player
  image, pinned by digest in `tools/versions.env`). No Python WoW protocol code in the
  hosted path. Design: `docs/designs/wowborg-v2-shim-adoption.md`.
- New: `shim.py` (supervisor), `bridge.py` (typed seam), `types.py`,
  `policies/random_walk.py` (T0: random 10–20 yd legs with typed movement settlements).
- Observability, three redundant channels: `trace.py` (JSONL + `WOWBORG-TRACE` stdout of
  every observation/intent/typed outcome), `artifact.py` (session-end evidence zip PUT to
  `COWORLD_PLAYER_ARTIFACT_UPLOAD_URL`), and rate-limited `/say` breadcrumbs
  (`ShimBridge.say`) that land inside the CWREPLAY itself.
- Honors the duration budget (`WOWBORG_DURATION_SECONDS`, default 120 s) — the v1
  "never self-terminates" defect is gone by construction (the shim stops the Nim client
  and exits; the base wrapper sends `done`).
- Validated locally: 45 unit tests; image builds amd64; end-to-end container smoke with
  a scripted fake king_richard (12 s, 12 legs, all `reached_target`).
- v1 login-stack modules retained for debugging; no longer the image entrypoint.

## v1 - idle login skeleton

- Version UUID: `6d3b00e5-512b-4c62-95c5-2a83367867b7` (uploaded 2026-07-13, `players-wowborg:dev` linux/amd64).
- Pure Python WoW realmd/world login client.
- Enters the seeded `wow_session.character_name`.
- Idles with periodic `CMSG_PING`.
- Does not decode world state or take gameplay actions.
- Does NOT honor the session's `deadline_seconds` — never self-terminates, so hosted
  episodes always run to the full variant deadline (fix in v2).
- First hosted smoke 2026-07-14: `xreq_23feebad-…`, 4 episodes on `orc-fresh-start`
  (5× self-play), all completed, score 0.0, no crash. Policy logs not retained; login
  success not yet confirmed from artifacts.
