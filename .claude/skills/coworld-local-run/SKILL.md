# Coworld Local Run (Gate-1 smoke test)

Run your **own** built policy image in a local Coworld episode and watch the result.
This is the **Gate-1** check in the improvement loop: confirm the change *took* and the
player **connects → plays → exits cleanly** — it is correctness/liveness only, **not** a
competitive test (you generally can't run other users' policies locally, so all
competitive judgment comes from experience requests; see `coworld-experience-requests`).

**Announce at start:** "Running a local Gate-1 smoke test of the built policy."

## Two footguns this skill guards (read first)

1. **Images must be `linux/amd64`** — the runner hard-fails on arm64. On Apple Silicon,
   build with `docker build --platform linux/amd64 -t <tag> .`
2. **Your policy image is the *positional* argument** to `run-episode`. Omit it and the
   runner **silently runs the manifest's reference player** — your change isn't under
   test even though the run "passes". `--run` alone does *not* swap the player; it only
   sets the argv for a supplied image.

## Workflow

1. **Build your policy `linux/amd64`** (game-specific build; e.g. the player's `build.sh`
   or `docker build --platform linux/amd64 -t <tag> .`).

2. **Smoke test it** — the helper does download (if needed) → amd64 check → run-episode
   with your image in every slot → a PASS/FAIL verdict + the replay command:

   ```bash
   cd /path/to/player_labs   # the repo root
   uv run python .claude/skills/coworld-local-run/scripts/smoke.py \
     --coworld <cow_id|name> --image <your-tag>:dev
   # multi-token entrypoint, longer timeout, custom out dir:
   uv run python .claude/skills/coworld-local-run/scripts/smoke.py \
     --coworld cow_... --image my:dev --run python --run -m --run my_player --timeout 180
   ```

   **Gate-1 passes** when it exits 0: the CLI exited cleanly (no game/player container
   crashed), `results.json` validated, and a `replay` was written. The default run uses
   the package's **certification** config, which is deliberately degenerate — **a score
   of 0 there is NOT a failure**; this checks liveness/correctness, not gameplay.

3. **Watch it** — the script prints the exact command; or open the viewer / watch live:

   ```bash
   uv run coworld replay <manifest> <out>/replay        # headless result → browser viewer
   uv run coworld play   <manifest> <your-tag>:dev      # watch a fresh local game live
   ```

## Doing it by hand (what the script runs)

```bash
uv run coworld download <cow_id|name>          # -> ./coworld/<cow_id>/coworld_manifest.json (+ pulls/tags game images)
uv run coworld run-episode ./coworld/<cow_id>/coworld_manifest.json \
    <your-tag>:dev --output-dir /tmp/smoke --timeout-seconds 120
uv run coworld replay ./coworld/<cow_id>/coworld_manifest.json /tmp/smoke/replay
```

`run-episode` writes `results.json`, `replay` (no extension), `config.json`, and
`logs/{game.stdout,game.stderr,policy_agent_<slot>}.log` to the output dir. The
positional image is reused for **all** slots (self-play); pass **one image per slot** to
mix players (there is no single-slot override — reference players are used only when you
supply *zero* images).

## Notes

- **`run` vs `play`:** `run-episode` is headless and writes the artifacts (the Gate-1
  case); `play` opens the live browser viewer and keeps the session alive — use it to
  watch a game in real time.
- **Real (non-degenerate) variant:** `run-episode` has no `--variant` (only `play`
  does). To smoke a fuller game headlessly, pass an `episode_request.json` whose
  `game_config` is the variant you want, or use `coworld play <manifest> <image>
  --variant <id>`. For competitive numbers, use experience requests, not local runs.
- **Auth/network:** `download` needs `softmax login` (for a name) + Docker + network to
  pull/tag the game image; once the game image and your `:dev` image are local, the run
  is offline. `cow_…` ids are stable; **names resolve to whatever is canonical now**.
- Full CLI reference (exact flags, outputs, every gotcha): `references/cli.md`.
- Verified against **coworld 0.1.20**.
