"""Gods of the Arena feature adapter for the `coworld-hypothesis-miner` engine.

Consumes the rows `miner_rows.py` writes (one per episode and own seat) and exposes the
`adapter` and `METAS` names the engine loads. Features come from end-of-game results and
the policy's own `LH` telemetry snapshots (240-tick resolution); nothing here needs a
replay re-simulation. Rows without telemetry keep only the result-derived features, so
the engine reports lower coverage for the telemetry ones instead of dropping the seat.

Score components are excluded per `score_kind` (set by `miner_rows.py --score`): XP is
25 per last hit, 150 per hero kill, 100 per building kill, and level is a function of XP,
so those cannot be allowed to "explain" an XP score.
