"""Paintbot PW fights: engagements, trades and opening duels (lab tool T4).

Reads pw_episodes tables (never the tape) and segments combat into engagements:

  engagements(ep)     one row per engagement: enemy damage events (a kill is a damage event
                      with killed=True) join one engagement when they are within
                      ENGAGEMENT_JOIN_TICKS of each other AND share a seat or have a
                      participant within ENGAGEMENT_JOIN_DISTANCE (single linkage in
                      space-time). Per engagement: N-vs-M, who hit first, who saw first
                      (needs visibility sampling), kills and HP per team, winner, hearts
                      affected, and time from first sighting to first hit.
  trade_events(kills) one row per death that was traded (killer killed by the victim's team
                      within TRADE_WINDOW_TICKS); same definition as pw_metrics.trades.
  opening_duels(ep)   one row per heart contest (a capture attempt: capture_start .. its
                      complete/reset): the first enemy kill near the heart and whether that
                      team won the contest.
  fight_policy_metrics(ep)  one row per (episode, policy_key): the A/B and miner unit.

Evidence kinds: every event is exact (hash-checked trace); the grouping thresholds are
choices (named constants below, printed with the output); "saw first" is sampled at the
trace's --vis-every; positions for heart distance come from the damage rows (exact).
