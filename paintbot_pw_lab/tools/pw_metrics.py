"""Paintbot PW metric library (lab tool T3): one definition of every metric.

Computed from pw_episodes tables at three levels:
  seat_metrics(ep)    one row per (episode, seat)
  policy_metrics(ep)  one row per (episode, policy_key): the unit for A/B and mining
  team_metrics(ep)    one row per (episode, team)
`METRICS` lists every column with its unit, denominator/definition and evidence kind
(exact = from the hash-checked trace; inferred = a documented heuristic; sampled = from
state rows every `state_every` ticks). A metric is null (NaN/None) when its input is
missing, never 0. Ratios at policy/team level are recomputed from summed numerators and
denominators, never averaged. Contract: paintbot_pw_lab/docs/tools/pw_metrics.md.
