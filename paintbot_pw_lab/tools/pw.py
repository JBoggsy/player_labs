"""One entry point for every Paintbot PW lab tool: `pw.py <subcommand> [args]`.

    uv run python paintbot_pw_lab/tools/pw.py tools [--json | --markdown]   # the catalog
    uv run python paintbot_pw_lab/tools/pw.py doctor [--json] [--offline]   # is the lab ready? fixes
    uv run python paintbot_pw_lab/tools/pw.py episodes ROOT --json          # any tool, forwarded
    uv run python paintbot_pw_lab/tools/pw.py <subcommand> --help           # that tool's own help

Every subcommand forwards its arguments unchanged to one tool and returns that tool's exit
code, so the tool's own flags, --json envelope and exit codes apply (docs/tools/README.md
"Agent contract"). `trace` and `map-raw` run the release's Nim binaries from
tools/bin/<tag>/ (a leading `--tag TAG` picks another build).

The catalog (CATALOG below) is the single source for `pw.py tools` and for
docs/tools/README.md, which is generated from it:

    uv run python paintbot_pw_lab/tools/pw.py tools --markdown > paintbot_pw_lab/docs/tools/README.md

Exit codes of `tools`: 0. Of `doctor`: 0 ready; 1 release.env is behind the league, or the
league check could not run (HTTP 429 rate limit / 5xx: wait and retry, or use --offline);
2 usage; 3 something is missing (binaries, Python deps, source clone, login or network), each
with the command that fixes it. Loop readiness (result.loop, from WORKING_CONTEXT.md's
"## Loop charter") and the active player (result.player) are reported but never change the
exit code.

AGENT_CONTRACT = """## Agent contract

Every Python tool (all subcommands above except `build`, `build-native`, `trace`, `map-raw`,
`mine` and `test`) follows one contract, implemented once in `tools/pw_cli.py`:

1. **Non-interactive.** `--help` documents every flag and ends with examples and the exit codes.
2. **`--json`** prints exactly ONE JSON object to stdout; all human-readable text (and anything
   native code or child processes print) goes to stderr. Keys:

   | Key | Meaning |
   | --- | --- |
   | `ok` | `true` exactly when the exit code is 0 |
   | `tool` | the tool name (`pw_metrics`, ...) |
   | `release_tag` | the engine build used (`--tag`, else `tools/release.env`) |
   | `inputs` | the parsed arguments |
   | `outputs` | every path the run wrote (caches the run created included) |
   | `counts` | `processed`, `failed`, `excluded`, plus tool-specific counts |
   | `failures` | `[{id, code, message}]`: one per failed episode, seat, or the usage/environment error |
   | `result` | the tool's payload (or a path to it) |
   | `next` | suggested follow-up commands; on exit 3, the fix command |

3. **Exit codes:** `0` success; `1` some inputs failed verification or loading (partial results
   are still written, failures listed); `2` usage or config error (failure code `usage_error`);
   `3` environment missing (binary, library or release not built; code `environment_missing`),
   and the message names the exact fixing command, for example
   `paintbot_pw_lab/tools/build_tools.sh`. An unexpected exception (a tool bug) still prints the
   envelope, exit 1 with failure code `crash` and the traceback on stderr. Exceptions to the
   envelope: `deployed-ref` and `release` report usage errors as plain argparse text (exit 2,
   no JSON), and the shell/binary subcommands (`build`, `build-native`, `trace`, `map-raw`,
   `mine`, `test`) have no `--json` at all (the dispatcher prints an envelope only when it
   refuses to run a binary that is not built).
4. **Deterministic outputs, idempotent re-runs.** Default output locations are documented per
   tool; files a tool writes without `--out` go under `paintbot_pw_lab/analysis/<tool>/` or next to
   the episode, at paths that depend only on the inputs. Traces and map rasters are cached
   (receipt-checked), public fetches skip episodes already on disk.
5. **Unknown selectors are usage errors.** A policy, seat, flag or metric name that is not in the
   data, or a time window past the end of every match, exits 2 and lists the valid values
   (`result.valid` in `--json`). An empty output never means success.

A loop reads the envelope like this:

```python
proc = subprocess.run([... , "--json"], capture_output=True, text=True)
env = json.loads(proc.stdout)
if proc.returncode == 3: run env["next"][0], then retry        # build / login / network
elif proc.returncode == 2: fix the arguments (env["failures"][0]["message"], env["result"]["valid"])
elif proc.returncode == 1: use env["result"], but report env["failures"]; never quote a failed episode
else: use env["result"]; env["next"] suggests the follow-up
```

### doctor

`pw.py doctor` runs these checks and lists a fix for each failure: Python dependencies in the
uv environment (`uv sync`), `tools/release.env` readable, every binary and the native library
for the pinned tag (`build_tools.sh` / `build_native.sh`), the library's build receipt matching
the tag, the paintbot-pw source clone (`git clone ...`), the shared skill engines (`ab_stats`,
`paired_stats`, `variance_miner`), and, unless `--offline`, `deployed_ref.py` (league build vs
`release.env`; needs `softmax login` and network). An HTTP 429 there is failure code
`rate_limited` (exit 1, `next`: wait and retry, or `doctor --offline`), not a login problem;
only 401/403 or no token suggests `uv run softmax login`.

It also reports, without changing the exit code:

- `result.player`: the active player id read from the local softmax credentials (no network).
  `uv run coworld player list` shows the names with the active one marked (`softmax status`
  does not show the active player).
- `result.loop = {ready, missing, charter_path}`: whether `## Loop charter` in
  `paintbot_pw_lab/WORKING_CONTEXT.md` is filled in (objective, policy_file, policy_name /
  player, baseline, opponents, allowed_changes, credit_budget, max_iterations; a field is
  unset when empty or still a `(...)` placeholder, a section saying "Not set" adds
  `not_set_marker`, and a set policy_file must exist, else `policy_file_exists`). When not
  ready, `next` points at the charter and the `paintbot-pw-loop` skill."""
