"""Paintbot PW opponent scouting and field survey from PUBLIC league data.

Three subcommands, all free (anonymous public reads, no credits, no auth):

  leaders who the division's current champions are, as policy refs for --opponent: the
          latest completed round's round_config.entrant_attributions (player -> exact
          policy_version_id), named from that round's episode rows (policy_name, version,
          owner), ranked by the public leaderboard (rank, MMR). Three reads. Unlike the
          leaderboard's policy_label (null for some champions, e.g. Alpha), every entrant of
          the round is resolved. HTTP 429 after pw_public's retries is exit 1, code rate_limited.

  fetch   list the league's recent completed rounds (/v2/rounds?league_id=...), then each
          round's episodes (/v2/rounds/<id>/episodes), and save each completed episode as
          <out>/r<round>_<ereq>/episode.json (the public row + round_id/round_number) and
          replay.gz (its public replay_url). Gentle by default: at most MAX_EPISODES_DEFAULT
          episodes; the pause, back-off and retry limit live in pw_public.py. Episodes already
          on disk are skipped without a request (re-runs are cheap). Field-study guard: the FIRST new episode is traced through pw_trace
          (pw_episodes.load_episode) before anything else is pulled; a failure stops the fetch.

  report  load the episodes (hash-checked, pw_episodes.load_batch), then write
          scout.json + scout.md (+ scout.interesting.json) with:
            standings        per policy: W-D-L, win rate with a Wilson interval, mean Elo outcome score
            matrix           policy x policy: n, W-L, win rate (Wilson), mean Elo outcome of the row
            profiles         per policy: opening first targets and first hearts reached, capture
                             order, weapon mix, grenade/spray use, pickups, fights, typical win
                             time, glory composition
            shouts           per policy: shout templates (numbers -> <n>), counts, examples with
                             tick/seat/position, and slot hints (which state field a number tracks)
            interesting      flagged episodes with an agent-written one-line reason (--reasons)
            sanity           warnings: flat 0%/100% aggregates, all-zero metrics, one side always
                             winning, mixed versions. Treat each as a tooling bug until disproved.

Identity: a side (team) belongs to one policy when all its seats share it (league episodes:
one policy per team). Key = exact policy_version_id (default) or policy_name (--by name,
pools versions: say so). Team comes from pw_episodes (public rows have no game_config.slots,
so team = seat parity, noted as team_from_parity). Heart and pickup names are given in
EMBER'S FRAME: for an Azure side, feature k is reported as its point mirror, so h0 is always
the side's own home heart and h1 the enemy's. Contract: docs/tools/pw_scout.md.
